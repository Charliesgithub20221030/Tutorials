# Introduction to Parallel Programming Using OpenMP

This is a tutorial for multi-core parallel programming using OpenMP. Modern CPUs usually have multiple cores,
     such as 16 cores. Also, each CPU may have multiple memory channels. If they are utilized properly, our
     applications can be over 10 times faster. Of course, the final performance depends on the hardware that
     the applications run on and how the applications are parallelized.
